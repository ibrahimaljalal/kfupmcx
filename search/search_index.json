Topics include the physics of flight, fuselage design, rotor design, drone dynamics, performance and stability, control systems, guidance and navigation, mission payloads, ground control systems, and autonomous systems. Students conceive, design, fabricate (in 3D prototype), and apply drones. This program also covers drone swarms, regulations, security, AI, and machine learning, and touches on emerging anti-drone solutions. Applications of this field are universal and have become omnipresent in most industries. The program emphasizes the applications of drones in the new digital economy by highlighting case studies of the utilization of drones in industries such as like oil and gas, logistics, environment, security, etc.</p>"},{"location":"AE/contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p>For more information about the Drone Design and Application Concentration contact this email:</p> <p>ibrahim.jalal@kfupm.edu.sa</p>"},{"location":"AE/courses/","title":"Courses","text":"<p>Drone Design and Application Concentration  Courses:</p> First Semester Course 1: AE 449 - Fundamentals of Unmanned Aerial Systems <p>This course presents students with the fundamentals of unmanned aerial systems.
